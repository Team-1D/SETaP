### Environment Setup
Once you have installed Python and Git, have your IDE set up, and have cloned the repository, you can use one of the provided `start` scripts to activate the [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), install Python dependencies, and start the backend server.

Setup scripts are provided for Mac, Linux and Windows. You can run the appropriate script for your operating system to get started.

#### Mac/Linux
```bash
./start.sh
```

#### Windows
```bash
./start.ps1

# or

./start.bat
```
