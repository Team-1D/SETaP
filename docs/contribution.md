### How we start it?

## Splitting into Frontend and Backend
Firstly, we expressed what our strengths and weakness are code wise. Then we all picked which part of the implementation we wanted to do (e.g mainly **HTML** and **CSS** or **Javascript**). As a team we were pretty even on half wanting to do backend and half wanting to do frontend. However, due to our different coding abilities we decided that it would be the best to have more experience coders work with the lesser experienced, so that they can help each other out when issues arises. 

## Breaking Down the Code
After that, we decided that we should break the code down to features that we are planning on including in our application. Once we had made a list of features, we assigned each function to a pair of frontend and backend team member. So that everyone had an equal amount they needed to implement and if one member has an easier and shorted feature they need to implement, then they will need to help others that have larger functions when they are done.

### Github Commits 

## Branches
Rather than making different branches for each feature we decided to just split the branches to frontend and backend so that team members can help each other out and the frontend can see how all the pages would look like integrated together. Additionally, the style of the application would then be consistent. Furthermore, the backend can help each other to have consistent error messages and coding style with the `GET` and `POST` functions. We used branches to allow us to have better version control and incase for any issues, it allows us to roll back our code.

## Different commits
Due to some member having the database installed on their laptop and other's do not have the database, we needed ask them to test our code and we would make the small edits on their computer can commit to the github so that others can get the fixed code on their own computers and continue developing it further. Therefore, some member may have a lot more commits than other members as some have committed less are more focused on pushing big commits when there are a large change to a feature, whereas others have done lots of small commits that are for fixing the code.
