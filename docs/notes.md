## Description
Allows users to write, save, and revise from personal notes.

### Features

### Justification
The Notes page is designed as the central feature for users to create and manage their revision materials in a customisable and engaging environment. It allows users to write, edit, and delete notes with flexible formatting options, which is vital for personalised study.

#### Why it was implemented
The main idea of REViiT was to make revision approachable. By allowing users to easily select templates, set difficulty levels, and change the color of their notes, we allow for various learning preferences and styles. Providing familiar structures help with the mental load of writing notes which is helpful especially during high-stress study periods.
