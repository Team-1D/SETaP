## Description
Interactive flashcards to test memory and revise concepts.

### Features
- Flip between question/answer
- Track progress
- May pull from database or local data

### Justification
The purpose of the flashcards feature is to support active recall which s a method that has been proven to be helpful with memory retention. Users can create, edit and delete flashcards with custom terms, definitions and background colours, allowing for a flexible way to use flashcards for revision. 

Users can also challenge themselves with these flashcards using the test mode that provides instant feedback and a point-based reward system to encourage participation with an incentive. We wanted to make this as gamified as possible to line up with our app's overall goal of making revision more interactive and rewarding.
